**Physiology**<br>
humans are bipedal, near-hairless, mammals with rectangular slab-like bodies. They evolved on a world of diverse, cyclically varying biomes as high-endurance hunter-scavengers who stalked larger organisms from a safe distance.

Humans are vertically oriented, with a spherical head sitting atop the brick-like torso. they have two pairs of limbs, one, used for ambulation, depends straight down from the torso, the other projecting on either side from the upper torso. the upper limbs are tipped with clusters of five segmented appendages used for gripping and manipulating objects. the tips of these fingers are equipped with broad flat keratin plates.

Human heads house most of the creature's sensory organs as well as the brain. They are spherical in shape with a tuft of fur at the top (males of the species may exhibit a secondary Lower Tuft). this tuft is largely ornamental, and is frequently shaved, cut or dyed to achieve various cosmetic affects. on either side is a small, oval ear that lies flat against the side. at the front, a large central bump contains two holes used for respiration and smell. Below this central bump is a hinged jaw used for feeding, respiration, and communication. Above the bump are two highly advanced eyes capable of discerning intensity and frequency of light in a narrow band. The eyes of a human are protected by highly-flexible ridges of fur called _eyebrows_ which may also be used to express sentiments of doubt to other humans, by raising them high above the eyes.

Human language is largely based around a prehensile tongue which is used to obstruct exhalation from the mouth in complex ways. This tongue also carries delicate sensory organs for analyzing food.

Modern humans possess only vestigial fur, leaving a thin, rubbery, epidermis exposed. the epidermis is coated with symbiotic bacteria and exudes various chemicals used to break down hostile RNA. the apparent color of this epidermis ranges from a pale pink to a dark brown, mainly as a function of opacity. Humans generate protective chemicals when exposed to stellar radiation, via a process known as _tanning_. This allows humans to survive in relatively hot or radioactive regions. 

**Psychology**<br>
Human psychology reflects their tiered, hive-like social structures and early scavenger lifestyle. 

Human society is built upon a set of pro-social beliefs called morality. the exact contents may vary, sometimes wildly, between nationalities and even sub-cultures, but they almost always include the ideas that giving up individual advantages and submitting to authority, giving accurate information when asked and generally making oneself useful to the community. much of human interaction involves a struggle to establish moral superiority. moral inferiors are expected to obey moral superiors.

In an adaptation to their strictly compartmentalized society, humans have evolved the ability to enter a psychological state of extreme empathy known as _vicarious living_ that allows individuals to project their sense of self onto others. this ability allows individuals to experience diverse social-roles and abilities beyond their own narrow specialization, which confers a sense of wholeness and purpose. higher-functioning individuals can vicariously live even through non-humans or fictional characters in printed works, but the majority require images or videos of other humans or figures that have been modified to have a human-like appearance. 

In advanced civilizations, even recreational activities and core biological functions are a matter of specialization and public spectation. generally humans will prefer to watch or read about someone else doing an activity rather than do it themselves. those who allow observation of their activities are rewarded with verbal praise. humans have a dependency on verbal praise, and in its absence will begin to psychologically deteriorate. conversely, many who acquire it may become addicted, and go on to progressively greater lengths to acquire it. In the most advanced stages, an oligarch may elevate such an individual to the rank of _celebrity_ and set it before the public to be worshiped. Images of human celebrities are printed out and placed in all major centers of commerce for the edification of the customers, alongside texts containing the details of their lives.

Humans in general have a deep-seated aversion to changes in outlook. The passive mode of this tendency is known as _confirmation bias_ in which all data is subconsciously groomed to support existing knowledge-base. The active mode is known as _indignation_ in which the source of offending data draws the aggression of the observer. This adaptation helps to maintain stability within society by creating a buffer against rapid changes in social behavior. Similarly, humans will tend to reject ideas that are not widely known or accepted by others of their social circle, requiring either a critical mass of information or confirmation from a social superior. To disagree with a human is to invite immediate hostility.

On average, humans are somewhat skeptical, but open to the possibility, that all reality was created by one or more invisible but omniscient, omnipotent and also benevolent gods, who turn dead humans into immortal ghosts in order to either pleasure or torture them forever depending on how strictly they followed the morality. 

**Civilization**<br>
Humans society is governed by two classes, the _Oligarchs_ and the _Politicians_. Historically and in smaller nationalities, a third warlord class also exerted governing force, but in modern times it is generally subordinate to the economic powers. The oligarchs govern industry and commerce while the politicians govern the collection of taxes and resolution of disputes. both oligarchs and politicians are viewed as morally and intellectually inferior to their subordinates, but their laws are obeyed by all but a few criminals.

Below these elite classes, humans rank themselves by the colors of their _collars_ (a type of clothing item worn about the neck). A white collars denotes membership in a scientific or engineering field while a blue collar denotes a manual laborer. below both of these are various classes of beggars collectively known as _red-necks_, a reference to the lack of any collar. 

In addition to hierarchical "economic status", humans sort themselves into a variety of overlapping sub-groups based on a combination of social role and heredity. these "social circles" form the basis of human interaction and social organization. Generally they are of two types, industrial and biological. industrial social circles are formed by individuals who share similar skills and social-role or who serve the same oligarch. biological social circles are composed of individuals who share common ancestors, especially if they also share a dwelling place.

Humans generally share the belief that humans are the most intelligent, versatile, and adaptable of all living things. Because of their craving to live vicariously through other entities, humans desire to send tourists to alien biomes and civilizations. Humans believe that by eating exotic lifeforms or keeping live specimens as pets/consorts, their powers of vicarious life are increased. Together, these needs drive the expansion of interstellar human empires. The oligarchs work to create paths to these resources by the most profitable means while the politicians work to remove obstacles for the oligarchs both internal and external.

Humans seek to destroy or domesticate all living things that do not adhere to the morality, but will seek to preserve organisms who appear willing, or likely to allow themselves, to subordinate themselves to their empire. Such organisms will eventually be integrated into human society, though it may take several generations for the novelty to wear off.
