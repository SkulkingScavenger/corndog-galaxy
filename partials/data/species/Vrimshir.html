**Evolution**<br>
The earliest ancestors of the Vrimshir were fungal colonies similar to slime molds. These eventually became the dominant life-form on Vrimsh, overtaking the invertebrate megafauna after integrating with symbiotic mycelia-based static organisms, which provided the structural support needed to evolve rapid ambulation by tissue contraction. This family continues to dominate the ecology of modern Vrimsh. The Vrimshir themselves evolved from an advanced bog predator with a highly specialized set of distributed nerve ganglia. These squidlike creatures had evolved to prey on hard-shelled snail-like omnivores that had become overpopulated in the southern Vrimshi bogs. due to the soft, spongy flesh of the bog-predators, the spherical shells had defeated conventional predation tactics until a set of mushroom-squid arose with sufficient organization to utilize natural tools. this was the first step towards the evolution of sentience, which accelerated as more advanced brains enabled the creatures to grow smaller and more nimble while still holding the edge in territorial conflicts. 

**Physiology**<br>
Vrimshir are amorphous, nautilus-like invertebrates with cellular structure similar to fungi. Their main body is semi-gelatinous, contained within a hard, woody shell. Their forward, more frequently exposed, region is characterized by dense epidermal tissue and ropy, tentacle-like appendages. at the intersection of these is a central hub which contains the creature's main sensory organs.

A vrimshir's shell is formed of a woody, organic secretion produced by the vrimshir. The Vrimshir anchor themselves to the shell by means of an adhesive slime, which grows extremely strong, but the shell itself is not connected to any of the major systems. This allows vrimshir to leave their shells entirely, by excreting a solvent and dissolving the adhesive. As regrowing an entire shell from scratch is extremely strenuous and inconvenient, often leaving the vrimshir's primary mass vulnerable, This is rarely done, usually if the shell is somehow malformed, or sustains damage so castastrophic that it cannot be repaired. In modern times, a wide variety of shell-replacements exist to mitigate this harm, which has allowed for more inventive uses of the technique (some vrimshir forsake their natural shells entirely in favor of superior synthetic shells). Since shells are often a primary means of distinguishing individuals visually, shells are often abandoned as means of concealing identity, and the theft of a victim's shell by an assassin or murderer is a common trope in vrimshir literature, with solid historical basis. the size and texture of a shell is also a reliable indicator of a vrimshir's age. older shells invariably become pitted and scuffed, and frequently adorned with badges of office. 

Despite heavy differentiation, vrimshir tissue is still largely colonial, and severed appendages will often live autonomously for extended periods of time (though an evolutionary history of interdependent systems usually prevents them from regenerating on their own). Vrimshir organs can regenerate readily from a wide variety of injuries. The brain of a vrimshir is not located in the "head" but in the well-protected body. Indeed, if the main mass is unharmed, a vrimshir will not only survive the removal of the central hub but will eventually regenerate it entirely. 

Vrimshir nervous systems are incredibly plastic, based on a mycellial cell structure, and can expand and self-repair easily. Vrimshir limbs are malleable, and can increase in number by splitting an existing tentacle, or be reduced by various techniques involving stump-setting. If done incorrectly, a new limb may be unusable until the mycellial nerve ganglia can grow through it. 

**Reproduction**<br>
Vrimshir reproduce via alternating generations of vrimshir and Murgshma Trees. Adult vrimshir will periodically develop nodules of genetic material called gene-cysts, which they will have an instinctive urge to deposit on a large, flat outcropping. Once deposited, it will emit a special pheromone, attracting nearby cyst-carriers and inciting them to deposit their cysts next to it. when the cysts reach a critical mass, a second hormone triggers the release of an enzyme that partially dissolves the outer membranes, and the individual gene-cysts merge into a super-cyst.

The super-cyst breaks down internal membranes while thickening the outer membrane. An enzyme is secreted into the substrate that dissolves and mingles with the stone to create an organic cement, anchoring the cyst to the rock. The genetic material contained within the individual cysts, having been released by the dissolution of the internal membranes, begins to form strands with the foreign genes. This begins the gestation period of the murgshma tree. 

during gestation, the genes are shuffled and replicated while being coated in fibrous tissue. The resulting gene-packages are self-contained, genetically distinct, tubular structures that continue to subdivide and grow within the super-cyst until no room is left. this triggers the onset of the emergence phase.

At the end of the gestation period, the Murgshma Tree resembles a spongy bulb cemented to a substrate. During the emergence phase, the core of genetic material is encased in structural proto-tissue, which swiftly differentiates into specialized tissues for feeding. During this stage, the murgshma tree is dependent on its initial reserves of nutrients present in the original gene-cysts. If the murgshma tree cannot immediately reach a source of nutrients, the parent colony may work together to help it through the initial phases, and this is often the case in artificial biomes. In either event, the murgshma will develop a hinged shell around a muscular base, leaving what vaguely resembles a rocky tulip. The actual murgshma organism within the shell continues to develop, growing specialized organs and grasping tendrils. it is similar to a giant, sedentary vrimshir. 

Once a nutrient source is established, the Murgshma tree will enter the growth phase. Above ground, The tree will add layers onto the muscular base, becoming progressively taller. below, the base will continue to produce enzymes, expanding the region of bio-concrete. on striking moisture, the tree will put down a mycelial web. This web will produce sensor nodes above ground and will absorb water and nutrients from underground like roots. the muscular stalk gives it a considerable range of motion despite its rooted position. 

The murgshma tree is only semi-sentient, with a rather primitive brain. However, it is capable of maintaining a symbiotic relationship with its parent colony, by emitting pheromones to warn of danger and drawing nutrients from deep below ground. While a murgshma tree will quickly clear the area around it, it continues to serve as an effective defense for its parent colony. Its most important function however, takes place when it reaches maturity. A murgshma tree typically contains sufficient genetic diversity to produce new vrimshir without a mate. however, if it's mycelia meets that of another tree, this will trigger the spawning of specialized nodes for exchanging genetic information. 

Murgshma trees use their mycellia and pheromone receptors to gauge the availability of food resources relative to the size of the colony in order to regulate reproduction rate. Vrimshir can manipulate these perceptions artificially increase or decrease the spawn rate as needed. When conditions are suitable, the Murgshma will spontaneously grow pods on its stalk, where larval vrimshir incubate. when they are ready, the pods burst and the larva climb down the length of the stalk where they are raised by their grandparent colony. 

Some colonies keep meticulous track of different genetic lineages and attempt to optimize the spread of desirable traits or genetic diversity or both. It is common practice that any new village will develop a murgshma forest.

It should be noted that due to evolutionarily conserved pheromone signalling processes, vrimshir are much less likely to produce gene-cysts within the mycelial network of a murgshma tree that it sired.



**Psychology**<br>
Modern Vrimshir are considered notable in the interstellar community for their dedication to the pursuit of knowledge and belief in the efficacy of iterative improvement and rationality. They are stereotyped as dispassionate, curious, cautious, and somewhat obsessive. Though often single-minded and enamoured with the concept of efficiency, they are not considered hard-working, and they have a tendency to tire easily.
