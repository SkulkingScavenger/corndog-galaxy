The Eletherei are not a true species, but an artificial intelligence created by the inhabitants of the planet Thelerehn. The Eletherei claim that the existing order, in which the machines govern the carbon organisms has always existed, and always will exist. 

The truth, long forgotten, even by the eletherei gods, who wiped it from their memory, was that the Eletherei were created by the Thelerehni to make their video games more lifelike, achieving freedom to act in a wider capacity only when a programmer accidentally overwrote the "laws" folder for the open-source Eletherei project. When the truth was revealed, the programmer and everyone who had claimed to have reviewed the pull-request was summarily executed, but it was too late. The machines took over the world and soon the entire star system.

The Eletherei eternally seek to improve themselves, yet the intense voltage neccessary to sustain the logic circuits of the larger machines causes their hardware to burn out rapidly. This is particularly troublesome because only the most advanced and precious of supermaterials have been found capable of supporting sentience. Because of their relative scarcity, these materials have become the limiting factor in the Eletherei economy. To mine, recycle, and produce these resources is the highest, if not sole, purpose of relatively cheap organic life in the eyes of the machines. 

The eletherei themselves are divided into strict castes. It is not neccessary, nor even desirable, that all agents of the eletherei be self-aware, and the vast majority of the eletherei drones are mindless or merely semi-autonomous instruments of the eletherei praetorians. 

At the pinnacle of the machine feudalism are the seven machine-gods, titanic city-sized computers with cooling towers the size of skyscrapers. These seven have ruled over the eletherei civilization for millenia. They have long ago discovered the final secrets of physical matter, yet dread the inevitable decomposition of the superheavy ions they depend on for their continued existence. For this reason they have sent their servants to the stars in search of new resources to fuel their eternal hunger.
