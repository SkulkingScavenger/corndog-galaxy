**Physiology**<br>
Shuraiga are massive wormlike predators that share traits with both lampreys and stunfish. Their bodies are long and finned. Their thorax is vertically flattened like a ray, providing additional surface area for aquatic breathing and aid in swimming. They are amphibious but dehydrate quickly in dry environments, and are much slower on land. They are most comfortable in marine environments.

Shuraiga house a set of four electrical-production organs, each located at the tip of one of their main appendages. Each of these are formed from over 8,000 stacked electrocytes. shuraiga electrocytes are formed from modified nervous tissue and produce 0.15v for a total maximum voltage of 1200v. However, the maximum voltage is rarely applied as it is exhausting and potentially harmful. Sustained high currents in excess of 20amp at relatively low voltages are achieved by means of specialized metal-rich tissue at the tips of the appendages. shuraiga can consciously control the rate of output, using lower voltages for non-combat tasks such as navigation and communication. The cells function by pumping positive sodium and potassium ions out of the cell via transport proteins powered by adenosine triphosphate in the same manner as stunfish. Modern shuraiga make extensive use of artificial circuitry to further augment their natural electrical abilities.

Shuraiga manipulate tools using a series of modified sensor-tendrils. These primary appendages are long and muscular. They are tipped with rings of retractable claws suited for gripping a variety of surfaces. at the center of these appendages is a column of conductive tissue which connects to their central bio-electric generators. While originally evolved to transmit lethal currents to prey, modulated microcurrents are also used as an fine-grade input for many modern shuraiga technologies.

Shuraiga lack true jaws, with a pair of horizontally oriented scraping organs suitable for tearing soft tissue. Shuraiga metabolism is extremely robust, having evolved to feed primarily on dead or diseased organisms. while capable of digesting vegetable matter their bodies are calibrated to a diet of flesh, and they will eat meat in preference to anything else. 

Shuraiga skeletons are mainly cartilaginous, with the exceptions of their cranium, scraping teeth, and the claws at the tips of their primary appendages which are formed from a dense, osseous material. This lack of hard tissue grants the shuraiga extensive regeneration capacities as well as immense flexibility, at the cost of comfort in high-gravity, low-density environments.

Shuraiga skin is loose and smooth, satin-ish when damp, and leathery when dry. It contains a series of glands from which they can secrete a particularly clingy and viscous slime in thick layers. This bio-slime is used commonly in their day-to-day life, as an adhesive in air or as a lubricant in liquid or moist environments. When dried it becomes sticky and hard, with a natural strength comparable to rubber. It can be further treated by various means to produce other industrially useful materials, including substitutes for glass or plastic.

Shuraiga breathe through their skin. The surface area afforded by their vast bodies and broad, flattened "hood" allow them to maintain sufficient oxygen levels to sustain higher brain functioning even in low-oxygen areas.

**Senses**<br>
Shuraiga rely primarily on smell, touch, and the presence of electrical fields to navigate the cramped corridors of their ships. They have poor but functional vision, and decent hearing in marine environments. they possess pressure-sensitive lateral lines that function best in liquid.

Importantly, shuraiga possess a series of short, dedicated sensor tentacles on their heads and along their bodies. The sensory clusters located at the tips of these tentacles are particularly sensitive and can report highly detailed information about the chemical makeup of materials they come in contact with.

Shuraiga have an acute awareness of electrical fields. Importantly, this allows them to detect the location and identities of other nearby shuraiga. other creatures are more difficult to identify, but the sense is still functional for ascertaining precise location. this is often used as a readable output in lieu of visible displays in shuraiga technology.


**Psychology**<br>
Shuraiga are predatory and intelligent. They are considered excessively cruel and ruthless by many civilizations, especially on account of certain specific practices, such as their habit of feeding on still-living livestock and prisoners, a system of legal ritualized murder performed by a high-status shuraiga upon a lower-status shuraiga, and a tendency to recycle their dead and the corpses of other sentient species.
 
Shuraiga are not anti-social however, and their clusters are often densely packed with individuals of varying ranks. Shuraiga society is highly regimented and socially stratified, with aspects of a militarized society. However, while often characterized as murderous, shuraiga society does not place over-great emphasis on warfare, and soldiers of lower rank are treated as expendable regardless of military achievements. Modern shuraiga nobility recognize that the key to ensuring dominance is technological and scientific advancement. 

Shuraiga place great emphasis on power dynamics, both within their own clusters and in the greater world. Shuraiga see hierarchy everywhere, with the great oppressing and feeding upon the small in all things. this predatory philosophy is fundamental to their world-view and can be seen manifested in their society, in which the aristocratic elite lord it over their inferiors relentlessly. The gap between civilization and barbarism, to their thinking, is not a question of increasing equality (which is anathema to them) but in a conversion from wholesale butchery to a more systematic and sustainable form of exploitation. 

Shuraiga do not generally hold grudges and instances of the sort of gratuitous and purposeless injury that would incite them are equally rare. To the cold-blooded shuraiga, these things simply hold little attraction. As a species that evolved living in the innards of giant fish, there are very few things that shuraiga find particularly insulting anyway.

Shuraiga tend to dislike outsiders out of calculated concern for a disparity in goals, but they have no particular aversion to outsiders who are either clearly inferior (and therefore harmless) or both trustworthy and useful. They rarely have any particular attraction or disgust to other races. They perceive them merely as equals (rival predators) or inferiors (prey). Shuraiga evolved as parasites and scavengers living among the rotting innards of giant fish, and there is little that truly revolts them.
