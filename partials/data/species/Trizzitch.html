The space between stars are not wholly devoid of life. Among the titanic horrors of the trans-cosmic gulfs are the Galaxyfish, vast, moon-sized behemoths who float upon the solar winds, fusing interstellar hydrogen in their immense cores and feasting on stardust. So vast are these creatures that their bodies are home to entire symbiotic ecosystems. The greatest of which are the sentient Trizzitch. 

The Trizzitch are relatively primitive, relying on the galaxyfish for interstellar transport. They worship the great fish on which they depend for life, and seek to keep them alive. Trizzitch civilizations meet only rarely, when the galaxyfish meet at planetary nebulae to breed and feed.  

As part of Trizzitch tradition, a few are always sent off to accompany the young galaxyfish. These starspawn begin life relatively small, the size of a large starship, but rapidly consume matter in the nebulae. Then, before they deplete their starting energy, they go like their parents to seek out the solar winds until the time comes to return.
