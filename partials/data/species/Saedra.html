Saedra are tall, skeletal-looking semi-vertebrates. The bulk of the interstellar population, including that of all the saedra core worlds and excluding that of rebel factions unrecognized by international organizations, is united under a theocracy from which the world and species takes its name. While historically the Saedra Ecclesiarchy acted as a distinct, if closely allied, body from the organs of mundane administration, The realities of interstellar politics and administration has led to the dominance of an ecclesiastically backed federation surmounting the nominally sovereign tribes. 


**Physiology**<br>
Saedrun is both hot and arid, and its inhabitants are widely adapted to these conditions. The Saedra themselves evolved from spider-like predators known as _surtana-kaeta_ or watchers-in-the-dunes. these are now mostly extinct in civilized lands, but after the rise of imperial Saedrun, the surviving specimens were elevated to a sacred status, and even on modern Saedrun, capital crimes are sometimes punished by ritual sacrifice. 

Saedra are structurally similar to arthropods, with skeletal muscles running through the insides of hollow bones, rather than anchored to the outside as in earth vertebrates. they are roughly humanoid in build, with a central trunk composed of a jointed thorax-abdomen. They possess two major sets of limbs which serve as arms and legs, and two further sets of nearly vestigial minor limbs. 

Their heads project forward at an acute angle from the thorax, with a prominent plate used to draw heat away from the cranium. As in many bipeds, the head contains most of their sensory organs, as well as their mouth and primary respiratory orifice. Saedra mouths consist of a pair each of grasping mandibles and chelicerae. They are specialized for eating, and do not connect to the lungs or vocal cords. 

A second opening in the face, above the mouth, is used for speech and respiration (despite similarities in location to the ever-popular nose, it has no olfactory function. Saedra detect scent through pores along their sides). The vocal cords as well as a series of muscular valves and sphincters act in combination to filter airflow and to communicate. Despite the lack of a tongue and teeth, Saedra can produce a large number of alien phonemes with practice, often sufficient for unaided communication. However, due to the piping, flutelike quality of saedra voices and the significance of this in most of their languages, non-saedra often find the converse does not hold. 

Saedra possess osseous, calcium rich exoskeletons which surround their internal organs and musculature. To support their height and mass, these are elaborately ribbed, especially in the thorax. the relative weakness of hollow bones by density is offset by internal structural supports and parallel musculature. Their elongated, skeletal appearance is an adaptation to prevent stress on this system. 

A second layer of flesh runs over the outside of their skeletons, which serves as a cooling system. The skin contains specialized silicon-rich tissue capable of converting light into electrical energy (similar to photovoltaic cells in functionality), which in turn is used to power the compression stage of an organic heat-pump known as the _Agadaeras_. 
This organ is located at the back of the thorax, and connects to the lungs. It evaporates, compresses, and condenses blood returning from the outer circulatory system, super heating pulmonic gasses before they are exhaled. The upshot of this effect is that the blood of the outer skin is cooled before returning to the inner organs, preventing overheating.


**Psychology**<br>
The Saedra have been shaped by many hostile forces, first by the natural bleakness and aridity of their world, then by the ravages of the great plagues that nearly led to their extinction, by the religion of austerity and cleanliness that arose to prevent them from ever occurring again, and finally the age of interstellar travel and entry into a new world of inter-civilization competition and strife. 

Saedra are natural survivalists. frugality and austerity is woven into both their instincts and their culture. Their social instincts are somewhat muted by intense competition from within the species during their evolution and most of their early history. Due to quirks of physiology, Pre-modern saedra were hosts to many contagious diseases and virulent parasites that left the host disfigured and agonized yet functional. This selected both for an ability to shrug off pain and an ability to remorselessly perform amputations, self-mutilation, and mercy killings when the need arose, as it often did. These traits were conserved both genetically and culturally into the present day, though their manifestation has adapted to new technological circumstances.

Science and inquiry have always been major focuses of Saedra culture. Curiosity and innovation drove their major cultural achievements and genetic milestones. Scholarship is revered and aspired to, even among the most warlike. Literary and scientific achievement are counted among the knightly virtues, along with austerity, hygiene, and loyalty. 

In these matters, Saedra religious institutions is generally more supportive than obstructive. At worst the ecclesiarchy will attempt to monopolize certain fields, particularly medicine and chemistry. The ecclesiarchy is not particularly attached to its mythology, which is intentionally vague and shrouded in mystery, and the "dogmas" owe their longevity and absolutism to the species' primal fear of disease, rather than a psychological need for moral authority, which for the saedra is somewhat atrophied. 

If anything, the Saedra have a weakness for the mysterious and the occult, and high-ranking clergy hold their revered status in large part due to their popular perception as knowers of hidden mysteries. There is certainly a great deal of overlap between the scientific, medical, and clerical communities that is far from unintentional.

Saedra are frequently attracted to fatalist and stoic philosophies, partly because these resonate with their natural outlook (possibly a holdover from their nomadic hunter phase, or even earlier, from the patient ambush predators they originally evolved from) and partly because of the undertones present culturally. More rarely this will take a negative turn towards nihilism or pessimism. existentialist and optimistic philosophies are generally viewed as curiosities and rarely gain traction among larger groups.

Saedra are notable for a highly pronounced, species-wide aversion to classic symptoms of disease. The scent or appearance of dirt, disease, or decay is often enough to trigger visceral responses in individuals who have not been previously desensitized. Their disgust at bodily fluids is exceptionally intense by the standards of most species, extending even to a disgust for opaque or viscous fluids generally. Injury or loss of limbs does not excite them to such abnormal degrees, but deformity often will, especially if it suggests exposure to certain kinds of wasting or consumptive illnesses common on premodern saedrun. 

This has led to an obsessive fascination with cleanliness and hygiene that has found ritualistic expression in the Dogmas of Bone. Their history has seen many fads and fashions designed to showcase health or hygienic living, though the traditional practice of ritual flaying, the step marking ordination into the Saedra clergy, remains the most extreme (at least that has ever seen widespread use). Full-body flaying is generally forbidden to the laity (both to ensure recognizability of vested clerics and because historically the loss of natural refrigeration provided by the outer skin would would have led to greatly impaired the ability of key agricultural workers to perform their duties) but specific anatomical regions for different classes are often permitted. flaying of hands and feet have often been approved for those working in unsanitary conditions, for instance. current laws are lax in most regions, but flaying of the face and neck are always reserved to the priesthood.
