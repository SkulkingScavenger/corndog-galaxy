Also known as darkmoons, blackmoons, and shadowstations, these moon-sized stations are self-sustained secret cities slowly drifting through Deadspace. They primarily serve as neutral grounds for criminal organizations and as places for space pirates to trade ill-gotten goods. These stations have thus become a major pillar in the ecology of the galactic underworld.


**Locations**<br>
Shadow Moons are always moving, partly to keep their locations secret and partly to ensure that they are accessible to clients across a wider area. However, while most vessels seek to travel by routes that maximize time spent near inhabited systems or along chains of deep-space resupply stations, Shadow moons remain strictly in Deadspace, the vast, empty gulfs between stars. This behavior is enabled by the resources constantly being brought to them by smugglers and pirates looking to trade off ill-gotten gains.

Because the shadow moons avoid standard interstellar routes and stick to the dark spaces between stars, the chance of discovering one by accident in the vastness of space is near to none. Instead, the coordinates of the stations are communicated to client organizations through various clandestine methods. Many rely on networks of scattered radio stations, whose transmissions may be heard by any vessel passing in range, but are only intelligible to those with the key to the encryption. Others produce cunningly programmed navigation droids who guide ships to their destination without divulging the coordinates to their possibly treacherous captains. 

**Inhabitants**<br>
The Clients of the Shadow Moons are a motley mix of criminals and exiles from every part of the galaxy. As havens and trading hubs for the galaxy's sizable criminal element, the moons are popular among sailors for their lawless starport cantinas, and among the influential for the anonymity and privacy of their palatial resorts. While pirates and criminals are common, the moons also attract unscrupulous and daring merchants, political dissidents, exiles, and anyone who wishes to vanish. 

The stations' crews are as cosmopolitan as the clients, but include a fair number of legitimate, if unscrupulous, laborers attracted by the wealth and luxury these stations have become notorious for. Experienced soldiers, cryptographers, and engineers are highly sought after, and the administrators spare no expense in maintaining the integrity of their domains.

Because of their critical importance as middlemen in the exchange of ill-gotten goods, the administrators of the shadow moons are immensely wealthy and influential figures. Together, these various criminal lords have been dubbed the Sinister Sixteen. Each is highly interested in maintaining the independence and prosperity of its station, while attempting to disgrace or weaken its rivals.
