The Zakasi Starcrawler is essentially a mobile battle station. It's crew consists of both technicians and warriors, both of whom may live on-board for decades. When positioned next to a star, its solar fins can power an idle vessel indefinitely, reserving it's radioactive fuel for combat and FTL transit.

Standard Operation involves wandering between transit lanes while cloaked and ripping unsuspecting merchants from hyperspace using the vessel's warp disruptor and crippling them using an array of insidious interference devices. Once the ship is trapped, the Starcrawler unloads it's squadrons of <i>Leech</i>-class Fighters to board the target and eliminate any remaining resistance.<br><br>


**Development**<br>
The precursors to the starcrawlers were unmanned satellites modified to retrieve heavy metals from Zakaas' radioactive moons. Only after the invention of the <a href="https://github.com/SkulkingScavenger/the-cool-tapes-galaxy/wiki/Zakasi-Hyperspace-Burrower">Hyperspace Burrower</a> were the starcrawlers fitted for use as transport vessels. From that point on, the starcrawlers were rapidly expanded and refitted until they reached their modern form. In fact, many of the earliest starcrawlers were built up piece by piece from one of the original scout vessels after the crew broke off from their clan and established the vessel as their _virr_.

**Cloaking Systems**<br>
Starcrawlers rely heavily on stealth and surprise to win lossless victories against numerically superior opponents. Starcrawlers are coated with light-bending and absorbing materials to evade and disrupt radar and telescopic imaging. To hide their heat signature, the ship's interior is covered with thermo-electric panels, which work together with background heat sensors to camouflage the ship's external temperature. As this method involves trapping heat within the vessel, care is taken to keep emissions low while outside combat, usually by running the ship on minimum power and shutting down the main generators. These measures, taken together, make the starcrawler difficult to detect, and even if detected may easily be mistaken for debris or an asteroid. 

**Replenishment Strategies**<br>
There are few civilizations willing to trade with Zakasi starcrawlers, and zakasi are notoriously lazy. In order to keep the starcrawlers alive in space indefinitely, the crew depends on taking raw supplies from uninhabited worlds (zakasi are mediocre as miners, so this is mostly in the form of liquids and organic material from the surface) or, more commonly, by piracy. 

After a prey vessel has been defeated, the starcrawler moves in range and takes hold with it's masses of magnetic umbilical cables. The captured ship is then cannibalized piece by piece over several months or even years depending on the size of the ship and the needs of the crew. More portable resources, such as fuel, food, currency, etc. are often carried over to the starcrawler within a few days. The initial boarding parties are traditionally allowed to plunder whatever they can carry back in their Leech. 

To replenish their native atmosphere of sulphur dioxide, zakasi maintain huge vats of Vrrak Maggots, which break down organic waste and sulphur hydroxide to create liquid water and sulphur-dioxide. these Vrrak double as a food source and organic waste disposal, and for this reason are preferred over mechanical methods of atmospheric regulation.

**Combat**<br>
Starcrawlers fight at advantage against most vessels while 3-5 lightseconds away. Starcrawlers prefer to initiate a fight with rail-delivered _Devilfish_ EMP Rockets to disable the enemy sensors, which due to their wide area of effect and post-launch navigation systems do not depend on FTL sensors to reliably hit a moving target. If the blast catches a lone target with it's fighters still on board, the battle may be ended before it even begins. 

If the enemy detects the Starcrawler in time to deploy countermeasures, or if engaged against multiple targets, Devilfish rockets are followed by Nuisance Rockets, disrupting enemy communications and radar. Once all enemy sensor arrays have been disabled, the Starcrawler closes and deploys the Leeches. 

In order to avoid damaging valuable cargo on board prey vessels, the starcrawler uses its rail guns primarily for defense, or if a fight is going badly. If the starcrawler has had time to deploy its Quantum Relay Sensor Field prior to the battle (i.e., if it initiates the battle via the _Harpoon_), The crew may be able to aim the cannons with enough precision to knock out engines or weapons systems without destroying the rest of the ship. Alternatively, if a field of entangled particles has been established, the rail-guns may still be used accurately within a few light-seconds of the target
