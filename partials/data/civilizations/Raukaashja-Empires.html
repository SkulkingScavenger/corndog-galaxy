The <a href="https://github.com/SkulkingScavenger/the-cool-tapes-galaxy/wiki/Raukaashja">Raukaashja</a> form tightly organized societies, or _Vauraashja_, predicated upon war and combat. The Vauraashja are further subdivided into biologically distinct castes known as _Zaraushja_. 

Though each of the major Raukaashja Empires has it's own capital star-system, the species homeworld, Shauraaj, is held sacred and most castes require their youth to make a pilgrimage as part of their coming of age rituals.

Raukaashja Society is driven by honor and for most Raukaashja, there is no greater honor than victory in battle. In times of peace, the Raukaashja turn to Gladiatorial Combat and Big Game Hunting to slake their thirst for combat against worthy foes. Even in the age of interstellar travel, Single Combat is frequently preferred to the legal system as a method of conflict resolution, and Military Achievement remains one of the only, and by far the most common, methods of upward social mobility. By contrast, to suffer a humiliation in battle (what precisely this entails varies by caste and empire) is considered worse than death and is grounds for ritual suicide.

However, as the Raukaashja empires go their ways and encounter new foes, even traditions as sacred as the codes have been altered where it becomes clear that such adaptation is necessary for victory. As technology advances, emphasis on single combat has slowly diminished and supporting roles such as weapons technicians and scouts have increased in honor.

**Government**<br>
Raukaashja empires are led by a hierarchy of aristocrats, at the pinnacle of which is an emperor. The details of governance varies from empire to empire, but the emperor's power is never absolute except in matters of war. Even when the emperor's power extends over legislative and economic matters without deference to councils or dedicated offices, even the emperor is subordinate to the rigid codes of the Sauraakji caste, which are absolute, and for violating which even an emperor may be made casteless and exiled. 

**Language**<br>
Each of the Raukaashja Empires speaks it's own variant of Raukaashja Common, the species' mother tongue. The Core Raukaashja language is considered sacred. As such it is carefully preserved and used for many of the species' rituals.

**Religion**<br>
The Raukaashja do not worship a deity but each of the castes adheres to its code with religious fervor. Raukaashja who deviate from their caste' code are exiled and stripped of honor, a fate considered worse than death by most Raukaashja. 

**Zaraushja**<br>
Raukaashja Zaraushja are societal and biological subgroups within a Vauraashja. Each Zaraushja is responsible for perpetuating it's genetics, and while transfer between Zaraushja is possible, applicants are carefully tested to ensure their genetics are suited for their new role. The various Zaraushja work together seamlessly for the benefit of the Vauraashja as dictated by their respective codes, but due to their extreme differences in outlook and habits, it is rare and even discouraged for individuals to form personal friendships between castes.

_Sauraakji_<br> 
The Sauraakji are Raukaashja nobles, serving as inter-caste rulers, military commanders, diplomats and legislators. Sauraakji are aloof and bound by strict societal protocols. They are recognizable by exaggerated and ornamental faceplates, and scything talons, decreased muscle mass relative to size, and great height. Sauraakji have much finer control of pheromone production and emission than other castes, and are more readily distinguishable to enable various commanders to communicate with their troops during pitched battles.

_Rau'Shjir_<br>
The rank and file soldiers of the Raukaashja. The Rau'Shjir are the most gregarious of the Raukaashja, valuing camaraderie, loyalty, and cooperation on par with personal prowess. They are the largest and toughest of the Raukaashja, with oversized exoskeletal armor and bulky musculature.

_Shiraaj_<br>
The most solitary of all Raukaashja, the Shiraaj originated as hunters and continue to serve their empire as specialists, scouts, assassins, and spies. Members of the Shiraaj castes place greater value on individual combat than on warfare, and consider the full _shir_, the process of locating, stalking, and retrieving a target, rather than the mere act of killing to be the source of honor. For the Shiraaji, stealth, retreat from disadvantageous circumstances and indirect methods are considered a mark of skill rather than acts of cowardice, while unnecessary collateral damage or allowing one's target to learn one's presence or identity are considered shameful. As the species' solo agents, Shiraaj are given far greater latitude both by their codes and by the larger Raukaashja society. Their relation to the standard chain of command is complex, and the authority of the Sauraakji over them is subject to limitations. 
Shiraaj are smaller and less armored than the Rau'Shjir, but faster, more agile and similar in strength. their epidermis and plating are capable of shifting color slightly darker or lighter to match their environment.

_Auraja_<br>
Skilled craftsmen and engineers, the Auraja are the lowest of the Raukaashja castes, as they do not ordinarily participate in combat, yet their lives are still considered far more valuable than any non-Raukaashja or the Zaurakiri. The Auraja codes revolve around excellence and industry rather than combat performance. Recent technological advancements have helped advance the Auraja in the eyes of other Raukaashja, and fleet engineers may achieve status equivalent to Rau'shjir. Auraja are the smallest of all Raukaashja, with diminished scythes and elongated, nimble fingers. 

_Zaurakiri_<br>
The Zaurakiri, or Casteless, are exiles, Raukaashja who have broken the codes of their caste and been stripped of honor. Banished from their empires and forbidden to return, most prefer to take their own lives. Those who do not may find work as mercenaries or criminals, attempting to forge their own codes. Other Raukaashja view them as less honorable than non-Raukaashja, yet more worthy as opponents due to their obvious biological superiority. Zaurakiri are often non-typical in their mentality, yet their instinctive aggression and ingrained obsession with honor and rank never entirely disappear.
