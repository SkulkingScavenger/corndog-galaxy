Shuraiga Clusters are self-governing societies built upon a patchwork web of geographical, political, and kin-based allegiances. The original clusters were tribal kin-groups occupying minor strongholds on Argatha, but as their weaponry and communications technologies have improved, so has their capacity for empire. Modern clusters will sometimes occupy several worlds. 

The organization of these clusters is invariably a brutal aristocracy. Sociopathic efficiency is the hallmark of shuraiga governance, and while Shuraiga as a species are highly individualist, the death-grip of the Shuraiga tyrannarchs on their cluster means all but the most ambitious will be ruthlessly driven to serve their superiors. This dynamic of the stronger bullying the weaker into submission repeats at all levels of shuraiga society. Law and punishment is arbitrary and based on results rather than some abstract conception of justice. A certain consistency in rewards and punishments is maintained out of cold-blooded interest in manipulating subordinates into higher levels of productivity, but this can easily dissolve if, like most shuraiga, the acting tyrannarch is possessed of a savage temper.

**Technology**<br>
Early Shuraiga evolved in marine environments, and their traditional methods of combustion were dramatically different from land-based "fires". the earliest form of combustion involved the ignition of magnesium, electrowinned directly from seawater. A more controlled and sophisticated method useful for advanced metallurgy involved a lambda-shaped furnace filled with liquid water (originally carved directly into stone). the two lower branches were open, containing an anode and a cathode respectively, through which the operator would supply an electrical current to initiate electrolysis. this results in the chemical separation of water into hydrogen and oxygen, which due to lower density, floats to the upper region of the furnace. these gases were then funneled into a combustion chamber where metal could be heated and forged.

Because of the presence of sea-water, their innate electrical generation abilities, and ability to "see" electrical fields, shuraiga developed electronics extremely early in their history. A telegraph-like device was in use even before metal weapons.

Mining was originally accomplished by the domestication of large mantis-shrimp-like crustaceans, which were later replaced by cannon-like cavitation devices. 

Modern Shuraiga technology features widespread use of electrical power, with many portable organically-powered devices. Bio-engineering is also favored by the shuraiga, with various utility-organisms providing everything from menial household services (generally preferred over droids, as they are less easily reprogrammed or bugged by rivals) to ambient lighting and self-preparing food.

**Society**<br>
Shuraiga social rank is a complex affair, with many tiers and bylaws. The resulting society is unapologetically exploitative, and proposes to ensure a form of brutal meritocracy. The bottom level of the pyramid is politically powerless, but has benefited substantially by the introduction of advanced automation. The slave castes of the Shuraiga industrial era were consigned to the meat farms long ago, and the modern underclass enjoys a relatively comfortable, if dull and sometimes dangerous, existence. Social mobility is consciously regulated by the elite to provide a pressure valve for dissent against the reigning order and as an incentive to innovation and quality work. Talented individuals kept artificially below their rightful rank are seen as dangerous, as they may have the capacity to rally support from the lower classes if other outlets for ambitions are thwarted. The reigning wisdom suggests that recruitment is superior to preemptive execution in these cases, especially if in the process, an obligation is tied to their post. In addition to promoting perceived high-quality individuals, weak or stupid leaders are sometimes convinced to voluntarily abnegate their positions but more frequently are simply assassinated.

Social rank is generally distinct from occupation, though of course some occupations are intrinsically higher or lower status. Due to advanced and ubiquitous automation, the vast bulk of modern shuraiga are engaged in administrative or scientific work.  

Early in their history, shuraiga had built expansive empires, but as automation improved, the need for cheap slave-labor diminished, and slave civilizations prone to revolt against the oppressive policies of their shuraiga masters were converted into meat-farms. Modern shuraiga clusters rarely attempt to subjugate sentient civilizations. stable regions within their dominion are pushed into parasitical alliances, and potentially dangerous civilizations are simply converted to meat-farms.

These habits strike many outsiders as excessively tyrannical or cruel, but the shuraiga themselves see themselves as occupying a happy middle ground, viewing less brutal civilizations as soft and overly sentimental. They see themselves and certain neighboring civilizations which share their views as "predator races" and the rest as "prey races". The absence of hierarchy they view as a curiosity at best, anarchy and inefficiency at worst. all the shuraiga who matter benefit from the pyramid scheme, after all. 

Furthermore, while shuraiga do not hesitate to inflict harm on captives or underlings, this is seen as a means rather than an end unto itself. Shuraiga generally do not torture their captives, with the exception of live-feeding (which is viewed as a traditional privilege of the aristocracy) or in the case of traitors, whose public suffering is considered a useful deterrent. 

While their perceived lack of morals has earned the shuraiga ill-will among many other civilization, they have a history of loyalty to their allies. Shuraiga within a social rank or family circle will, if both survive an initial period of sometimes-violent trial, settle into a routine of mutual benefit. Once established, these relationships often last indefinitely. They tend to be rational and brutally efficient, but also mindful of the long-term repercussions of broken trust or excessive provocation.  

**Language**<br>
Shuraiga clusters each have their own language.

**Religion**<br>
Shuraiga worship an elaborate pantheon of hideous death-gods.
