The <a href="https://github.com/SkulkingScavenger/the-cool-tapes-galaxy/wiki/Saedra">Saedra</a> species was united long ago under a mighty empire known for its advanced technology and austere ways. The species, planet, and empire take their name from the universal tribe of priests, whose theocracy sits at the heart of the species' society. 

A sense of duty and obligation is strongly felt at all levels of society, but it is embodied in the warriors of the empire, the aescetic saedra knights. recruited from the sons of tribal chieftains, only after a career of glorious achievement on the frontiers may they return to a life of quiet administration. until then, they train rigorously both physically and mentally under the guidance of dedicated priests. Indeed, even where such knights are not fully inducted into a martial order, they are seen as partial participants in the priesthood, for like the priests they are engaged in war against the decadent skin (high ranking knights are even allowed to flense parts of their facial skin). The saedra knights are responsible for leading their cybernetic armies to acquire and defend resources for the empire, sacrificing their own lives if necessary. 

Saedra society is tightly knit, retaining the inherent tribalism of its pre-industrial age at its core. The filtering of technological innovation through a cabalistic theocracy rather than financially motivated private corporations allowed leading social engineers to shield society from rapid change, with new advancements slowly trickling down over generations under the oversight of religious hierarchs. In this way, the saedra have avoided dramatic breaks in historical continuity. Even where secular powers have occasionally thrown off the yoke of the ecclesiarchy, over milennia the keepers of history have gradually erased such blemishes. Only the innermost circles of the theocracy know the sordid truth of the species full history, and they use this knowledge to ensure that such catastrophes cannot recur.

In day to day life, the plurality of tribal saedra engage in manufacture, engineering, or agriculture, with the remainder scattered across various service industries including fine crafts. Modern saedra society is sufficiently automated that most truly menial tasks are undertaken by machines. A substantial portion of the total population is employed in one of the lower ranks of the ecclesiarchy or as a member of the secular bureaucracy. lay scholars have existed since the earliest days of the empire (always kept outside the sacred fields of biology and chemistry of course), but in modern times their numbers have swelled to be considered as a category unto themselves. Though not full members of the priesthood, they are partially funded by it and therefore partially controlled. This is not generally seen as a bad situation for any party. much of the theocracy's oversight is willing, as an endorsement from the priesthood is incredibly weighty among scholarly groups, respected even outside the empire.

**Language**<br>
Historically, the Saedra Tribes each developed their own languages. After the great plague and the rise of the Saedra Theocracy, The foundations for a common tongue was laid by means of the priesthood. Members of the clergy were recruited from all tribes, taught the sacred language of the Scrolls Physic and frequently sent back to minister to their parent tribe. Since speakers of the sacred tongue could be guaranteed to exist in all parts of the planet, it became convenient for travelers or diplomats to learn it rather than the hundreds of various tribal languages, and rely on the local clergy for interpretation. The advantages of this were readily apparent, and while tribal dialects were still used even to the present day, the sacred tongue became so commonly taught as to be universal. The modern form known as _Saedra Common Speech_ has grown somewhat apart from that fossilized in the Sacred Scrolls, which is still taught to the priests. The Sacred Speech is still taught to initiates of the priesthood, as well as various ciphers used by the inner circles, but in common society it has been largely displaced by the vernacular version.

**Religion**<br>
The Saedra Theocracy was founded by the Physician King Akaedara, of the powerful Saedra Tribe. Akaedara claimed to have received a vision of the great plague, a scourge of the decadent skin. In this vision, Akaedara saw a legion of walking bones amid a valley of filth and dying saedrin. wherever a survivor begged for relief, the bone-walkers lifted it from the swamp of flesh and flayed off his outer skin, after which he joined their company. Citing this prophetic vision as inspiration, Akaedara flensed himself clean. The saedra were a wealthy and powerful tribe and many of its leading members led lives of ease and indulgence. The pain of flensing repulsed them, but when word of the scourge reached the tribe, many begged akaedara to teach them. Eventually the plague reached the tribe of saedra, borne through the air by tiny parasites. The priests of Akaedara alone survived. From this remnant, Akaedara formed a college of elite physicians and proscribed to them strict rules of life. These Saedra Priests then dispersed throughout the tribes, bringing their life-saving medicines.

This was the origin of the Saedra Ecclesiarchy. Since that time, the priests have monopolized the study and practice of medical science, becoming increasingly cryptic and cabalistic as the years went by. Akaedara himself is believed to have never died. One day he vanished, leaving behind the last of the Saedra Scrolls, which detailed an extensive ritual of selecting his successor and a final cryptic message to "those who would defeat the last and greatest of all ailments". The latter led to the widespread legend of Akaedara's immortality, though some skeptics believe that it was rather a result of Akaedara's lifelong obsession with finding a cure for the Great Plague. The Scrolls of Physic contain the accumulated medical knowledge of the Saedra. The Saedra Scrolls are those written by Aakaedara himself, and comprise the core of the First Cycle texts.   

Despite the ritualistic behavior of the priests and general belief in the supernatural, The Saedra do not revere a deity, and the religion takes an agnostic attitude towards the genuinely supernatural. There is a pervasive belief in unknown or unknowable factors underlying biological and physical life. The rites and dogmas are sacred, but while believed to be supernaturally inspired, are not seen as infallible and have been improved through the millennia. In modern practice, traditional rites are carried out alongside verified cures wherever they have not been proven harmful. This is partly for the genuine advantages from the placebo effect, partly to preserve the mystique of the priesthood, and partly from a genuine belief among the lesser clergy that there is some secret power preserved within the rites. 

The combination of implicit trust in the Dogmas of the Theocracy with a fundamental admission of imperfect knowledge on the part of the priests can be largely explained by the secrecy of the inner circles. Although most of the practices described in the Saedra Scrolls have been obsolete for millenia, with the advent of modern surgical techniques and bio-engineering, the existence of a body of hidden lore has led to a belief that there are meanings beyond the obvious. The higher clergy have, from time to time, effected apparently miraculous cures, reversing hopeless cases or predicting side-effects of new technologies that would not be conclusively proven for centuries. The hierarchs deliberately work to create an atmosphere in which the effects of "supernatural" agents cannot be entirely dismissed, though some heretics insist that they accomplish this by hoarding research and technologies that could easily be made public.

The Ecclesiarchy justifies its strict secrecy and rigorous admission policies by the need to protect the body of medical knowledge from impurities. Malpractice is certainly rare and harshly punished (failure to follow proper medical procedure can result in anything from loss of future opportunities to ritual execution, depending on severity). New techniques and technologies are rigorously tested in secret for years or even centuries on hundreds of subjects before they are finally encoded in the Scrolls of Physic and approved for use by the clergy. While this has arguably slowed the pace of medical research, it has led to a nearly non-existent level of quackery within the profession, and in the long run it has paid off. Saedra operations are some of the safest and highest success-rate of any species, despite the complexity and fragility of their anatomy. Heretical healers will sometimes offer their services to those pronounced incurable by the ecclesiarchy, but this is seen as an act of utter desperation. 

Test subjects are drawn primarily from criminals. to be sentenced to imprisonment as an object of research is a common sentence in saedra courts, and while often excessive, it is viewed as a way to recoup some of society's investment in a criminal while also serving as an effective deterent. Such criminals are stripped of all legal protection, and securely imprisoned in clean but spartan cells. Subjects that must be deliberately infected or maimed are always drawn from this class. However, saedra of good social standing will also volunteer for research for a variety of reasons. Sometimes it is a matter of personal atonement for dishonorable activity, other times a final act of piety by a saedrin who despairs of any other purpose, sometimes in exchange for basic care (elderly and crippled saedra without living family will often volunteer for low-risk research). A few healthy individuals have historically volunteered to help advance specific causes, as in the case of a saedra knight whose mate suffered from the then-incurable siphoning-pox. For these, the Saedra Martyrs, exacting levels of respect and kindness are mandated. They are not confined beyond what is necessary to maintain sterility of the temple grounds and the interests of public health and are preferred for low-risk research. The theocracy provides comfortable living conditions and seeks to accommodate the subjects' wishes whenever reasonable.
