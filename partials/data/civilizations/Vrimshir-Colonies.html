In their original societies, the fungal <a href="https://github.com/SkulkingScavenger/the-cool-tapes-galaxy/wiki/Vrimshir">Vrimshir</a> naturally organized themselves into kin-based groups. As they advanced in intelligence and complexity, the vrimshir developed increasingly sophisticated means of communicating at large distances, opening up the possibilities of larger societies. modern vrimshir colonies tend to be planet-sized or smaller. 

Modern Vrimshir societies are founded on rational principles of optimized individual and group welfare. The dominant social theories have fluctuated over the millenia, but modern vrimshir have considered the principles of non-violent in-group competition, meritocracy, policies of iterative improvement, and individual-communal balance to be paradigmatic since before their interstellar phase. In keeping with these principles, they eschew monolithic empires in favor of self-sustaining and self-governing colonies with the the ability to flexibly augment or improve social policies in light of new data, including favorable or unfavorable results obtained by those of their sister-colonies. Thus vrimshir societies vary considerably in specifics but tend to even out over time.

**Language**<br>
Natural Vrimshir communication is performed by vibrations within the stomach, constricting and relaxing the sac-like organ to create a sort of musical gurgling. this is exceptionally difficult for non-vrimshir to reproduce, and similarly, vrimshir find it extremely difficult to replicate the noises of tongue-and-tube based communicators without technological assistance. in low-tech environments, vrimshir will prefer to communicate by writing. Vrimshir have sophisticated hearing organs and can learn to understand a wide variety of spoken languages that they cannot physically replicate.

Vrimshir languages have suffered a general loss of diversity over the millenia, correlating closely to advancements in communication technology. Each of the major colonies maintains its own official language, but modern vrimshir languages all borrow heavily from each other. "legacy" languages are preserved in digital recordings and written documents, but as important works are regularly translated, these are considered an anthropological resource rather than a utility.

**Religion**<br>
Vrimshir are imaginative, somewhat slothful and highly curious. Fictional Stories are reasonably popular in their culture, and early vrimshir societies held many beliefs that could be considered mythical. However, vrimshir never experienced a phase of organized religion on any significant scale. The requisite combination of missionary zeal and a capacity for unquestioning belief is quite rare, and widely considered distasteful. The concept of "supernature" is somewhat foreign to them. To vrimshir thinking, either a physical law can be broken (disproving it as a law) or it cannot. similarly, they place little emphasis on a physical-immaterial dichotomy. When Vormulghshir the ever-quaffing proved that invisible gases had volume and mass it was considered a fairly exciting discovery but created no cultural waves. consciousness, the origin of various aspects of the universe, and the optimal ordering of society are considered distinct areas of scientific interest.
