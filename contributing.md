#Contributing to The Cool Tapes Galaxy
The Cool Tapes Galaxy is an open-source community project and we welcome volunteer contributions. 
If you can create assets, develop features, fix bugs, or write lore, we can use your help.
Depending on your familiarity with git and/or unity (or lack thereof) its possible to get overwhelmed just diving into a big project.<br>
**DON'T PANIC**<br>
If you can't find what you need in this guide, you can contact the project admin at SkulkingScavenger@gmail.com for quick questions. 

# Getting Started

For anything besides editing the wiki, you will need **git**, a **github account** and **editing rights**. If you have those, proceed. If not, you can...<br> 
 * download git for free <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">here</a><br>
 * create a free account <a href="https://github.com/join?source=header-home">here</a><br>
 * send me your correctly spelled **github username** at SkulkingScavenger@gmail.com or on discord<br>
 
 If you want to test your changes (good idea), or play the game, you need Unity3D which you can get for free <a href="https://unity3d.com/">here</a>
 
Then consult the following helpful guides:

# Submitting a Bug Report
  Submit Bugs to SkulkingScavenger@gmail.com or open an issue on github. Alternatively, complain on discord.

# Contributing Code
The Cool Tapes Galaxy is written in C# using the Unity3D game engine. If you know how to use these things, thats great. 
If not, watch out. All the guides online are pretty useless imo, but good luck. Hit me up on discord for a crash course if you want.

Be sure to read our <a href="https://github.com/SkulkingScavenger/the-cool-tapes-galaxy/wiki/Coding-Standards">Coding Standards</a> 
and our <a href="https://github.com/SkulkingScavenger/the-cool-tapes-galaxy/wiki/Making-a-Pull-Request">Pull Request Guidelines</a>.

# Help Develop the World
<a href="https://github.com/SkulkingScavenger/the-cool-tapes-galaxy/wiki">Visit The Wiki</a>. This is where we keep our most official lore.
For less official lore, chat it up in the discord channel. But if you really want to get your stuff into the game, the wiki is the way to go.
We have standards and stuff but don't worry about it. 
Our actual vision is way too nebulous and esoteric to actually describe even to ourselves so just have at it.
Be professional, Respect to your elders etc. etc. you get the idea. 
We're always going back to make tonal revisions and grammatical fixes so its not like you're going to destroy the world. 
This is a **Collaborative Effort** so make up whatever you want and put it in.

# Contributing Assets
All assets, be they graphics, music, or text, follow the same core workflow: 
pull down the project, add your changes, and make a pull request. 
Further details depend specifically on what kind of asset you want to contribute.

Refer to the following helpful guides for details:
