A Spehssmen Simulator for Advanced Neckbeards

# What?
You heard me. <a href="https://github.com/SkulkingScavenger/the-cool-tapes-galaxy/wiki">Go to The Wiki</a> if you want the fluff.

# Can I help?
Yes.

# How I can help?
Use that wiki to contribute concepts/lore/etc./etc. This is a **Collaborative Effort** so make up whatever you want and put it in. We'll make tonal adjustments later. for everything else, check out our <a href="https://github.com/SkulkingScavenger/the-cool-tapes-galaxy/blob/master/contributing.md">Contribution Guide</a>

# Why would I want to help?
Maybe because you want this game to be finished in your lifetime, maybe you've always wanted to be part of something bigger and less coordinated than yourself, or maybe you just hate programmer art and painful music. It honestly doesn't matter, no one here will question your motives as long as you're being useful.

# I'll never join in your evil plans!
Not with that attitude you won't.
