# The Cool Tapes Galaxy
A Spehssmen Simulator for Advanced Neckbeards

# What?
You heard me. <a href="https://github.com/SkulkingScavenger/the-cool-tapes-galaxy/wiki">Go to The Wiki</a> if you want the fluff.

# How you can Help 

Use that wiki to contribute concepts/lore/etc./etc. This is a **Collaborative Effort** so make up whatever you want and put it in. We'll make tonal adjustments later.

# How you can Help WITH THE GAME

You need to pull down the code, add your changes, and make a pull request.

For loading assets, you just need **git**, a **github account** and **editing rights**. If you have those, proceed. If not, you can...<br> 
 * download git for free <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">here</a><br>
 * create a free account <a href="https://github.com/join?source=header-home">here</a><br>
 * send me your correctly spelled **github username** at SkulkingScavenger@gmail.com or on discord<br>
 
 If you want to test your changes (good idea), or play the game, you need Unity3D which you can get for free <a href="https://unity3d.com/">here</a>
