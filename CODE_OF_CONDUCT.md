# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We pledge allegiance to party planet<br>
And to the dictatorship for which it stands<br>
To protect the world from devastation<br>
To unite all people within our nation<br>
To denounce the evils of truth and love<br>
To extend our reach to the stars above<br>
One Galaxy, Under Partygeist,<br>
Indivisible by zero,<br>
and fun for the whole family<br>
The End.

## The Overmind's Pledge (cooler than ours)

Know that I am the Overmind, the eternal will of the Swarm, and that you have been created to serve me. Behold that I shall set you amongst the greatest of my Cerebrates, that you might benefit from their wisdom and experience.<br>
If ever your flesh should fail, that flesh shall be made anew. That is my covenant with all Cerebrates.<br>

## Our Responsibilities

SkulkingScavenger is responsible for making up the standards of acceptable behavior and can be expected to take arbitrary and exaggerated action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, reject, vandalize, insult, and/or joke at the expense of comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, opinions, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to whine at, demote, bite their fingers at, or permaban any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, stupid, repetitive, or heretical.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies everywhere and at all times forever and ever but especially while representing the project or community. 
Examples of representing the project or community include impersonating SkulkingScavenger, announcing "I am the cool tapes galaxy project incarnate" over loudspeaker, or wearing the Official The-Cool-Tapes-Galaxy Ultra-Hat in public. 
Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified at the sole and arbitrary discretion of SkulkingScavenger.

## Enforcement

Instances of embarrassing, stupid, heretical, or otherwise unacceptable behavior should be immediately reported to the chief of secret police at SkulkingScavenger@gmail.com. We will review and investigate everything we can get our hands on, and retaliate in a way that we feel like at the time. <br>
The secret police value their informers and promise to **never** sell them out or leak their information unless we really, really want to.

Project maintainers who fail in their duties may face dire consequences as determined by SkulkingScavenger.
