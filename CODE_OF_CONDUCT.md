# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We pledge allegiance to party planet<br>
And to the dictatorship for which it stands<br>
To protect the world from devastation<br>
To unite all people within our nation<br>
To denounce the evils of truth and love<br>
To extend our reach to the stars above<br>
One Galaxy, Under Partygeist,<br>
Indivisible,<br>
and fun for the whole family<br>
The End.

## The Overmind's Pledge (cooler than ours)

Know that I am the Overmind, the eternal will of the Swarm, and that you have been created to serve me. Behold that I shall set you amongst the greatest of my Cerebrates, that you might benefit from their wisdom and experience.<br>
If ever your flesh should fail, that flesh shall be made anew. That is my covenant with all Cerebrates.<br>

## Our Responsibilities

SkulkingScavenger is responsible for making up the standards of acceptable behavior and can be expected to take arbitrary and exaggerated action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, vandalize, insult, joke-at-the-expense-of, and/or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, opinions, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, heretical, repetitive, or stupid.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies everywhere and at all times forever and ever but especially while representing the project or community. 
Examples of representing the project or community include impersonations of SkulkingScavenger, waving a flag that says "I am the cool tapes galaxy project incarnate", or wearing the Official The-Cool-Tapes-Galaxy Ultra-Hat in public. 
Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified at the sole and arbitrary discretion of SkulkingScavenger.

## Enforcement

Instances of embarrassing, stupid, heretical, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the chief of secret police at SkulkingScavenger@gmail.com. The secret police will review and investigate everything they can get their hands on, and will crack down in a way that they feel like at the time. 
The secret police value their informers and promise to **never** sell them out or leak their information unless they really, really want to.

Project maintainers who fail in their duties may face dire consequences as determined by SkulkingScavenger.
